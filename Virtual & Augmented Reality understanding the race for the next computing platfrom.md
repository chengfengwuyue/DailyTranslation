# Virtual & Augmented Reality understanding the race for the next computing platfrom
虚拟现实&增强现实：理解下一代计算平台的竞争

Virtual and augmented reality have the potential to become the next big computing platform.All around us are examples of where VR(which immerses the user in a virtual world)and AR（which overlays digital information onto the physical world）can reshape existing ways of doing things-from buying a new home to interaction with a doctor or watching a concert.In the first of a new Profiles in Innovation series,we examine what VR/AR could become,the evolving use cases and the markets that could be crated and disrupted.

Portfolio manager's summary

Our base case is an $80bn VR/AR industry by 2025(p.14)
Virtual reality(VR)and augmented reality(AR) have the potential to become the next big computing platform,and as we saw with the PC and smartphone ,we expect new markets to be created and existing markets to be disrupted.There's no shortage of examples of how VR and AR can reshape existing ways of doing things-from buying a new hom,ineracting with a doctor,or watching a football game,As the technology advances,price points decline,and entire new marketplace of applications(both business and consumer)hit the market,we believe VR/AR has the potential to spawn a multibillion-dollar industry,and possibly be as game changing as the advent of the PC.This report aims to show what VR/AR could become,the evolving use cases,the potential market disruption,and the challenge of moving from science fiction to widespresd adoption.We see both VR(which immerses the user in a virtual world)and AR(which overlays digital informarion onto the physical world) as driving a trend towards the adoption of head-mounted-devices(HMDs)as a new computing form factor.
